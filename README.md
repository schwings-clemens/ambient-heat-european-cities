# High-resolution projections of ambient heat for major European cities using different heat metrics

This repository contains scripts and supplementary data for the article of Schwingshackl et al., to be submitted to NHESS.

The scripts are divided into three major parts:
- data preparation (directory Scripts1_PrepData): calculation of ESAT and GSAT, extraction of data in and around the 36 considered cities, HWMId calculation, calculation of yearly maximum values and summer (JJA) means
- plot preparation (directory Scripts2_PrepPlot): preparation of TXx and TNx changes, preparation of exceedances of TX and TN above predefined thresholds, preparation of HWMId, preparation of explanatory and response variables for Figure 5
- plotting (directory Scripts3_Plot): creation of the figures used in the main manuscript and in the supplementary material

Additionally, the repository contains the names and coordinates of the investigated cities, the list of EURO-CORDEX, CMIP5, and CMIP6 models used, and the functions used to calculate HWMId in/around the cities and over all of Europe.
