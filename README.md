# High-resolution projections of ambient heat for major European cities using different heat metrics
#This repository contains the scripts used for data processing and plotting to create the results presented in Schwingshackl et al., in preparation to be submitted to NHESS.

The scripts are divided into three major 
- data preparation (directory Scripts1_PrepData): calculation of ESAT and GSAT, extraction of data in and around 36 considered cities for all considered datasets, HWMId calculation, calculation of yearly maximum values and summer (JJA) means
- plot preparation (directory Scripts2_PrepPlot): calculation of TXx and TNx, preparation of TX changes for plots, preparation of HWMId for plot, preparation of explanatory and response variables (for Figure 5) 
- plotting (directory Scripts3_Plot)
